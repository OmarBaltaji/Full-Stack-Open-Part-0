title New Note in a Single Page App

browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
server-->browser: {"message":"note created"}

note over browser:
in the spa.js file, the event handler
that gets triggered on form submission
sends the new note to the server
and then renders it in the browser
along the other notes without
redirecting.
end note
